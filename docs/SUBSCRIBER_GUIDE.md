**Hybrid Issues:**

- Public sections visible to all
- Premium sections locked unless you have NFT

## Accessing Premium Content

### Prerequisites

1. Connected wallet
2. Access NFT for the newsletter in your wallet
3. Internet connection

### Unlocking Premium Content

1. **Navigate to Issue:**
   - Go to an issue with premium content
   - You'll see locked sections marked with 🔒

2. **Check Your Access:**
   - If you own the access NFT, you'll see "Unlock Premium" button
   - If you don't own the NFT, you'll see "Get Access" button

3. **Unlock Content:**
   - Click "Unlock Premium"
   - The platform verifies your NFT ownership
   - Approve the Seal verification transaction (no gas fee)
   - Premium content decrypts automatically
   - Read the full content!

### How It Works

The platform uses cryptographic access control:

1. **Verification:** Your NFT ownership is verified on-chain
2. **Approval:** Seal key servers approve your access
3. **Decryption:** Content decrypts in your browser
4. **Privacy:** Decryption happens locally, content never sent to servers

**Important:** Decryption keys are temporary and never stored. You may need to unlock again in a new session.

## Managing Subscriptions

### Following Newsletters

Stay updated on your favorite newsletters:

1. **Subscribe:**
   - Go to a newsletter page
   - Click "Subscribe" button
   - Approve the transaction (small gas fee)
   - You're now subscribed!

2. **View Subscriptions:**
   - Click "My Subscriptions" in navigation
   - See all newsletters you follow
   - Quick access to new issues

3. **Unsubscribe:**
   - Go to newsletter page
   - Click "Unsubscribe"
   - Approve the transaction
   - Subscription removed

### Subscription vs. Access

**Important Distinction:**

**Subscription (Following):**
- Free to do
- Helps you track newsletters
- Enables notifications (if available)
- Does NOT grant access to premium content

**Access NFT:**
- May require purchase
- Grants access to premium content
- Transferable
- Can be sold or traded

You can subscribe without having an access NFT, and vice versa.
