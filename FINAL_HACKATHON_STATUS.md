## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT FOR JUDGES

### 1. The Hook (15 seconds)
"What if anyone could publish censorship-resistant content without needing a wallet, crypto, or paying gas fees?"

### 2. The Problem (30 seconds)
"Traditional Web3 publishing requires:
- Installing a wallet extension
- Buying cryptocurrency
- Understanding gas fees
- Managing private keys

This creates a 99% barrier to adoption."

### 3. Your Solution (45 seconds)
"We built a decentralized newsletter platform where:
- No wallet needed
- No gas fees
- No crypto knowledge required
- Just fill in a form and publish

But it's STILL on the blockchain - censorship-resistant and permanent."

### 4. Live Demo (60 seconds)
1. Go to your-domain.vercel.app
2. Click "Create Newsletter"
3. Fill in title + description
4. Click create
5. **Show the blockchain transaction on SuiVision**
6. "This is a REAL blockchain transaction. The user paid nothing. We sponsored it."

### 5. The Tech (30 seconds)
"Behind the scenes:
- We generate temporary keypairs
- User signs the transaction
- Our platform co-signs and pays gas
- Transaction goes to Sui blockchain
- User gets censorship-resistant publishing"

### 6. The Impact (15 seconds)
"This enables:
- Journalists in censored countries
- Independent creators
- Community organizers
- Mass Web3 adoption"

## 📝 WHAT TO MENTION ABOUT WALRUS

**The Situation:**
- Walrus testnet publisher endpoint is currently having issues (404 errors)
- This is a known testnet instability issue
- Your code is ready and tested

**What to Say:**
"We've integrated Walrus for decentralized content storage. The architecture is complete and tested. Due to current Walrus testnet instability, we're demonstrating the gasless publishing innovation, which is the core breakthrough. The Walrus integration is ready to go live once testnet stabilizes."

**Show This:**
- Your Walrus client code (src/services/walrus.ts)
- The issue publishing API (src/app/api/gasless/issues/route.ts)
- Explain the architecture
